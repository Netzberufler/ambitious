# Ambitious

Ambitious is an experimental [Block-based WordPress Theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/block-based-themes/). The header, navigation menu, content area and the footer section are made entirely out of Gutenberg Blocks.

[Theme Demo](https://demo.germanthemes.de/ambitious/)

## Things explored with this theme

- Tested typical block templates like 404.html, archive.html, home.html, page.html and single.html
- Created a more complex structure of block template parts using subfolders
- Explored how to provide a home page template with blocks using the front-page.html
- Tried out the navigation block and added a basic mobile dropdown menu

1. Install and activate the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) plugin
